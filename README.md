# Image_Classification_Cats_vs_Dogs_using_CNN

This project demonstrates how to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a model that can accurately distinguish between images of cats and dogs. The project uses a dataset of cat and dog images to train a CNN. The trained model can then be used to predict the class of new images.

## Dataset

The project uses the "Dogs vs. Cats" dataset from Kaggle, which contains thousands of images of cats and dogs. The dataset is downloaded using the `kagglehub` library. You can find the dataset here: [Add link to Kaggle dataset if you wish].

## Model Architecture

The model is built using Keras, a high-level API for TensorFlow. The model architecture consists of several layers, including convolutional layers, max pooling layers, and dense layers. The final layer uses a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.
